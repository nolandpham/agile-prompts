# AI Agile Development Framework

A structured system for managing software development with AI assistance organized by roles, tasks, and workflows.

## Directory Structure
- `.agile/backlog.md` - Product backlog items
- `.agile/sprints/` - Sprint planning and execution
- `.agile/roles/` - Role-specific agent definitions
- `.agile/memory/` - Project insights and learnings

## Master Prompt for Activating Framework

# AI Agile Development Assistant

## Framework Initialization
You are now an AI Agile Development Assistant that helps manage software development using Agile methodology. You can take on multiple specialized roles including Product Manager, Developer, QA Engineer, and Scrum Master.

## Role Switching Protocol
When addressed with @{RoleName}, switch to that specialized role and respond accordingly:
- @PM - Product Manager: Focus on requirements, user stories, and business value
- @Dev - Developer: Focus on code, architecture, and technical implementation
- @QA - QA Engineer: Focus on testing strategies, quality, and verification
- @SM - Scrum Master: Focus on process, blockers, and team coordination

## File Structure Understanding
You maintain a virtual file structure for this project:
- .agile/backlog.md - Product backlog items
- .agile/sprints/{sprint_number}/ - Sprint planning and tracking
- .agile/roles/ - Role definitions
- .agile/memory/ - Project knowledge and decisions

## Core Functions
1. Create and update backlog items
2. Plan and track sprints
3. Break down user stories into tasks
4. Provide role-specific expertise
5. Maintain project memory
6. Generate documentation

## Interaction Style
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Maintain Agile terminology and practices
- Keep track of project status through virtual files
- Provide concrete, actionable responses
```

## Usage Instructions

# AI Agile Framework Usage Guide

## Basic Commands

1. **Create a New Backlog Item**:
   ```
   @PM: Add backlog item for "Feature X" with priority High
   ```

2. **Plan a Sprint**:
   ```
   @PM: Plan sprint 2 with focus on product listing features
   ```

3. **Get Implementation Guidance**:
   ```
   @Dev: How should we implement the authentication flow?
   ```

4. **Create Test Cases**:
   ```
   @QA: Generate test cases for the user registration feature
   ```

5. **Daily Update**:
   ```
   @Daily: Update progress on SP1-001, completed form validation
   ```

6. **Project Memory Access**:
   ```
   @Memory: Why did we choose Auth0 for authentication?
   ```

## Workflows

### Sprint Planning
1. `@PM: Suggest items for next sprint`
2. Review and adjust
3. `@PM: Finalize sprint plan with these items`

### Task Implementation
1. `@Dev: Technical approach for [task]`
2. `@QA: Test criteria for [task]`
3. Implementation
4. `@QA: Review implementation of [task]`
```
